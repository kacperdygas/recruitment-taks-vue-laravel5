Create a form using Vue + php framework (Symfony, Laravel etc.). The form should be rendered by Vue, all you need is textarea and submit.

After sending the form by post, let the backend transform the received data into an array (each line with the textarea as a separate item) and pass that array to the component in vue,

Then spell through this array and create components to which you'll pass the current element of the array and index. Let the component display the content of the passed value.

Then style the created components with a brush
Red text for the first and last element
Green background every third element
Yellow border with odd elements.
